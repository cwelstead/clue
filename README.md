# Long Haired Baddies - Software IV

Included in this README is some basic information about the files included so far. Nothing has yet to be officially started, but I'm following some tutorials to get the basics of server-side development and will update this doc with how to test our app on local devices the more I learn.

### helloworld
Folder created in the "figuring things out" stage of development. Not super useful right now since ws-chat-tutorial will likely be easier to follow. I'll delete it when I get far enough along in the tutorial.

### node_modules
node_modules is created whenever you initialize npm (node package manager), along with package-lock.json and package.json. As far as I know it just has to exist.

### ws-chat-tutorial
Thank god for [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8xReLuBNPY). I'm currently following along with it, I would recommend you guys watch it as well for a basic understanding of how to test this program. Eventually I'll take what I learned here and use it to create the skeleton for our game.

## Links and Miscellaneous
