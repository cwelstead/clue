# Long Haired Baddies - Software IV

Included in this README is some basic information about the files included so far. Nothing has yet to be officially started, but I'm following some tutorials to get the basics of server-side development and will update this doc with how to test our app on local devices the more I learn.

### classes
I wanted a place for my Lobby object to go, putting it in this folder for now. If we need to change or update infrastructure as we go I am all for it.

### node_modules
node_modules is created whenever you initialize npm (node package manager), along with package-lock.json and package.json. As far as I know it just has to exist.

### ws-chat-tutorial
Thank god for [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8xReLuBNPY). I'm currently following along with it, I would recommend you guys watch it as well for a basic understanding of how to test this program. Eventually I'll take what I learned here and use it to create the skeleton for our game.

## Links and Miscellaneous
Make sure to install Git if you want to use version control through VSCode<br>
Install the Live Server extension on VSCode for local testing<br>
You'll need to follow some of the tutorial in order to install all the required items on your computer, specifically node.js and maybe a couple others<br>
Use bash for your terminal if you're having problems with powershell or cmd<br>
[uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid#uuidv7options-buffer-offset) might be a super helpful library for unique user IDs if we need them<br>
